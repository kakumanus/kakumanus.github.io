            <h2>More About Me.</h2>

            <p>
                I studied computer science and worked as a full-stack software engineer for nearly four years,
                but I've always been drawn to cities: how people move through them, who they serve, and who
                they leave out. Now I'm pursuing a masters in Urban Spatial Analytics at Penn, where I'm
                learning to use data, spatial analysis, and urban research to support better decision-making
                around housing and transportation access.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't believe technology should be built in a vacuum. Being a good engineer or technologist
                means knowing how to work with stakeholders and communities, especially when it comes to
                the urban systems that shape daily life. That mindset, blending technical work with planning
                and public impact, is what's driving the next chapter of my career.
            </p>
